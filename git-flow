Repos have two main branches: 
  - master(deployed to production) and 
  - staging (deployed to staging).

When working on a feature or bug fix:
 - pull from remote staging repo
 - checkout the feature "feature/my_feature" or "bug/my_bug" from local staging
 - dev and test locally
 - merge into staging locally
 - deploy to remote staging repo (which is set to auto deploy through beanstalk to staging site)
 - test on staging site
 - notify QA with link to staging url
 
 Deploying live:
 if your feature or bug has been approved.
 - notify QA deploy to production is about to begin.
 - local checkout master
 - pull from remote master repo
 - merge local staging into master
 - push to master repo (set to manual deploy through beanstalk).
 - if push is successful then do manual deply
 - notify QA with link to production url
